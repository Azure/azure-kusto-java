![Released Version](https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/com.microsoft.azure.kusto/kusto-ingest.svg)


master: [![Build status](https://msazure.visualstudio.com/One/_apis/build/status/Custom/Kusto/azure-kusto-java-sdk%20ci?branchName=master)](https://msazure.visualstudio.com/One/_build/latest?definitionId=57651)
![Github Actions Build](https://github.com/Azure/azure-kusto-java/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)


This is the Microsoft Azure Kusto client library which allows communication with Kusto to bring data in (ingest) and query information already stored in the database.
This library contains 3 different modules:
- data: The main client that allows interaction with Kusto, including creating a connection, issuing (control) commands and querying data
- ingest: Provides an easy way to bring data into Kusto
- quickstart: Self-contained, configurable and runnable sample app for easily getting started with the SDK
- samples: Sample code implementing various scenarios

# Install

## Maven

This method is the easiest to follow, just add the following dependency to your pom.xml:
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.microsoft.azure.kusto</groupId>
    <artifactId>kusto-ingest</artifactId>
    <version>2.1.2</version>
</dependency>
```

## Clone
Download the source code, compile and install locally.

One way to do this is by using maven like in the following example:
```
git clone git://github.com/Azure/azure-kusto-java.git
cd azure-kusto-java
mvn install
```

# Prerequisites

- A Java Developer Kit (JDK), version 1.8 or later
- Maven

# Samples

- [Execute a query](samples/README.md#execute-query-sample)
- [Ingest a file](samples/README.md#file-ingestion-sample)
- [Check status of an ingest operation](samples/README.md#query-table-status-sample)

## Using A Proxy
The SDK includes support for the built-in proxy system properties in java.
For example, when the address of your proxy server is 1.2.3.4:8989, you can run:  
`java -ea -Dhttp.proxyHost=1.2.34 -Dhttp.proxyPort=8989 -Dhttps.proxyHost=1.2.3.4 -Dhttps.proxyPort=8989`  
And the SDK will know to use these values automatically.

Alternatively, you can define a proxy programmatically when creating a client, using `HttpClientProperties`:  
```java
HttpClientProperties httpClientProperties = HttpClientProperties.builder()
        .proxy(new HttpHost("1.2.3.4", 8989))
        .credentialsProvider(credentialsProvider)
        .build();

Client = ClientFactory.createClient(<engine_connection_string>, httpClientProperties); 
// Or for DM:
IngestClient ingestClient = IngestClientFactory.createClient(<dm_connection_string>, httpClientProperties)

```

## Best Practices
See the SDK [best practices guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/data-explorer/kusto/api/netfx/kusto-ingest-best-practices), which though written for the .NET SDK, applies similarly here.
